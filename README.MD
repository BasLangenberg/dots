# Dots

## Outline

Originally, this said:

"I like immutable infrastructure. My favorite development and general working platform is an Arch Linux based system with i3wm using a bunch of commandline tools."

"Let's make that immutable too."

In the end, this repository is meant to be a portable dotfile repository setting up everything with Ansible, targetting WSL2 / Ubuntu on Windows 10.

## Features

## Test

For testing with an Ubuntu, use the provided Vagrantfile with this repo.
